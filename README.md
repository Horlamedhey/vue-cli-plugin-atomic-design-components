#vue-cli-plugin-atomic-design-components

TThis is Vue cli 3 plugin is a collection of generically used Vue components based on [Atomic Design ](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology. This plugin is NOT an off the shelf library like Bootstrap or Vuetify but rather a starting point to save development time on generically used components and giving maximum control.

This library depends on the following vue cli plugins

[vue-cli-plugin-atomic-design](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-cli-plugin-atomic-design)

[vue-cli-plugin-scss-base](https://github.com/milad-alizadeh/vue-cli-plugin-scss-base#readme)

Upon install all the components are copied to `./src/components` folder and you can edit the components markup and styling as you wish. You can also delet the components you don't need to improve performance. This plugin uses [Storyook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) as the development enviornment to maximise reusability and ease of maintenence. It also is a design system. [Here is why](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/style-guide-driven-design-systems/) a using design system is important.

You can view the storybook demo of the app here.
